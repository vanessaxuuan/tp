## Project: Teaching Assistant Contact Helper (TACH)

TACH helps CS Teaching Assistants tutoring multiple modules & classes by keeping
track of their students and monitoring their progress on their tutorials.
It is optimized for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing
in commands.

The following sections below summarise my contributions to this project.

* **New Feature**: Added GitHub, Telegram and Tutorial Group feature.
  * What it does: allows users to store GitHub, Telegram and Tutorial Groups as data.
  * Justification: This features allows the application to be more specialised to our target users (CS TAs).
  * Highlights: GitHub and Telegram are modified to be able to be empty. Difficulty faced in storing data that can be empty because the base project does not allow any empty fields.
* **New Feature**: Added deletetgall feature.
  * What it does: Deletes all the provided tutorial group from all students in the list.
  * Justification: This feature allows TAs to remove his contact list if he was reassigned to another tutorial group. Can be used at end of semester as well.
