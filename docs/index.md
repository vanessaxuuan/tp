The Teaching Assistant Contact Helper (TACH) is a desktop app that helps Computer Science (CS)
Teaching Assistants tutoring multiple tutorial groups, by **managing their students in an organised manner**.
sorting feature allows TAs to **view, categorize and get information** of all their students in a glance.
It is optimized for Command Line Interface (CLI) users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by
typing in commands. While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using the CLI.

* If you are interested in using TACH, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TACH, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
